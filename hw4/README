## HW4: Projections
## CSCI-5229 Fall 2016 Computer Graphics

## Hours spent to complete: 6 hours

Create an OpenGL program this allows a scene to be viewed in both orthogonal
and perspective projections. The program should allow the scene to be viewed
from multiple eye positions directed by user input.

You may NOT use the CSCIx229 library for this assignment.

The scene should consist of several 3D solid objects. You may want to simply
expand on Homework 3.  Using GLU and GLUT objects are still prohibited.

The program should allow the scene to be viewed from different viewpoints using
the cursor keys or mouse.  The orthogonal and perspective projections should
allow the entire scene to be viewed on the screen.  Although the scene would
look slightly different between the projections, the view should be from the
same vantage point.

The program should allow a third mode which provides for first person
navigation using a perspective projection.  The cursor keys should allow the
user to traverse the scene.

What to turn in:
1) Source code including makefile to build hw4;
2) Readme with instructions;
3) Approximate time it took to complete the assignment.

The purpose of this assignment is to give you some experience with different
projections. While for any project the projection will be dictated by the
specific application, realistic scenes would generally be in perspective,
while orthogonal projections would appear in CAD and similar applications. You
may want to start by getting you scene created in 3D and view it only using
the orthogonal projection, and then add the perspective projection second,and
finally the first person navigation.


### To make: 
Open Terminal or Terminator on Ubuntu, cd to the 'hw4' directory, you will see both the "hw4.c" and "makefile", enter command "make".

### To run this program:
Open Terminal or Terminator on Ubuntu, after "make" process, cd to the the 'hw4' directory and enter command "./hw4". Or simply double click the exe file named "hw4" in the Files.

Key bindings:
	p/P        Toggles ortogonal/perspective projection
	+/-        Change field of view of perspective
	x/X        Toggle axes
	m/M        Toggle Megaman
	c/C        Toggle Cutman
	arrows     Change view angle
	PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
	0          Reset view angle
	ESC        Exit
